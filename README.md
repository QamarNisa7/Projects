# Projects
Brief list of some projects I have worked on in my last 4 years focusing on Data Science & AI.

### Recommendation System & Analytics for PMF product	
Added Recommendation system model to Personal Finance Management application of client on Android and iOS for by performing ETL, Market Basket Analysis, Collaborative filtering using Python, XGBoost and Watson Machine Learning	
- Defined the scope and project plan for the POC building. Conducted skilling workshops for client as per requirements.
- Analyzed data of client, wrangled customer activity data of 12 million transactions with customer budget to ready for recommendation system, resulting in aggregated data providing additional revenue streams for client.
- Identified analytics requirements, introduced feature to add chatbot in application using IBM Watson Assistant, Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech for UX. Recommendation system prediction added for 640k users with 74% accuracy on sample data.

### Early Detection of Self-harm of Internet users	
Research study, applied Deep Learning to historical unstructured data of 450 users for sequential classification, achieving <10% error rate and 88% recall.
- Increased model accuracy by 12% via creating custom data processing algorithm for Transformer based deep learning architectures to deal with sentence length problem and data loss.
- Generated word embeddings using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)and applied logistic regression for sequence classification.
- Participated in CLEF eRisk Conference 2021, presented the work and methodology in the conference.

### Banking Customer Care and Transactional Chatbot	
Designed & Implemented Banking Chatbot for Client, achieving 82% accuracy on intents and entities.	
- Design thinking for Chatbot use-case, implementation of relevant replies from chatbot and integration with 3rd party banking API using webhooks

### Sentiment analysis on Twitter data	
Processed live user data and sentiment analysis on a user’s tweet and predict optimal time to tweet for getting maximum likes and retweets.	
- Scraped data using open-source Tweepy library and cleaned it into structured data for time-series analysis, applied Watson natural language understanding to detect categories, topics of tweets. 
- Applied EDA on data to identify trends, categories, most talked about topic for the twitter user etc.

### Trusted AI	
Research initiative to work on Explainable AI Models, applied open-source AIX360 toolkit on titanic data for interpretation of explainers.
- Applied AIX360 on Jupyter Notebooks using python and sci-kit library. Checked explainability of Logistic regression, random forest and neural network models keeping different personas of users in mind.
